we first yield the initial values of a and b, and then in each iteration, we use if-else conditions to calculate the next Fibonacci number. The condition checks which of the two numbers (a or b) is smaller and updates it accordingly. 
This way, the generator continues to produce the Fibonacci series defined by the mathematical recurrence relationship.
